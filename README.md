# Skills workshop - building commonly used instances using class methods

Duration: ~15 minutes

By the end of this workshop you should be able to:

  * compare class methods to instance methods.
  * utilise class methods to build instances of a class.

To complete this workshop, clone this repo to your local machine, then `bundle` and run `rspec`. You should see 2 failing tests. In your pairs, refactor the code to make the tests pass. Pay attention to make your code simple, DRY and communicative.
